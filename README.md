# SoftwareTesting


Project One & Two Reflections
Ensuring Functional and Secure Code
To ensure functionality and security in my code, I adhere to rigorous testing and design principles. I write comprehensive unit tests that verify both the expected outcomes and the handling of edge cases, as seen in my Contact Service tests for Project One. These tests serve not just to confirm functionality but also to act as an early warning system for potential security vulnerabilities. To bolster security further, I follow secure coding practices, like input validation and error handling, and stay updated on security patches and best practices.

Interpreting User Needs
Interpreting user needs is about translating requirements into functional software. I engage with stakeholders to gather detailed requirements and feedback. This dialogue is critical as it guides the iterative development of features like contact management and appointment scheduling. My tests reflect real-world usage scenarios, ensuring that the software remains aligned with user expectations and needs.

Approach to Designing Software
My approach to designing software involves laying a foundation based on the principles of modularity, scalability, and maintainability. I believe in designing with the end in mind, which means anticipating future needs and potential system expansions. For instance, the structure of the Contact and Appointment services in Project One is crafted to allow easy updates and new feature integrations.

In documenting my projects, I ensure that both the high-level overview and the minute details are captured. This balanced documentation serves as a compass for me and any collaborators who might join or take over the project. Through my portfolio, I aim to demonstrate not just my technical abilities but also my thought process and the underlying principles that guide my software engineering practices.
